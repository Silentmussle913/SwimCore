# SwimCore: The engine of swim.gg
So basically imagine a game engine placed ontop of PocketMine.

## Getting Started

- **Minimum PHP Version**: 8.2 (8.4 JIT recommended for production servers)
- **PocketMine Version**: Swim Services has a fork of the NetherGames PocketMine for multi-version support.
  - Using the normal NGPM and distributed PocketMine PHP binaries should also work fine. 
  - HIGHLY recommended you use NGPM or our own fork of Pocketmine [here](https://github.com/Swim-Services/PocketMine-MP).
- **Virions**: The virions we use for SwimCore are listed below in the example `.poggit.yml`. You need to download them off poggit/github and place them in the `virions` directory.

### Example `.poggit.yml` Configuration:
```yaml
projects:
  swim:
    path: ""
    compressBuilds: false
    libs:
      - src: poggit/libasynql/libasynql 
        version: ^4.1.0
        epitope: .random
      - src: Ifera/ScoreFactory/ScoreFactory
        version: ^3.1.0
      - src: jojoe77777/FormAPI/libFormAPI
        version: ^2.1.1
      - src: muqsit/InvMenu/InvMenu
        version: ^4.4.1
      - src: jasonw4331/libpmquery/libpmquery
        version: ^1.0.0
      - src: kaxyum/CameraAPI/CameraHandler
        version: ^1.0.0
      - src: muqsit/simplepackethandler/SimplePacketHandler
        version: ^0.1.5
      - src: CortexPE/Commando/Commando
        version: ^3.2.0
```

## World Setup

- SwimCore keeps a copy of worlds to autoload in a directory called `savedWorlds`.
- Both the `savedWorlds` and `worlds` directories must have a world named `hub` to use as the default hub world.

---

## Database Setup

- **Database Type**: SwimCore uses MariaDB with MySQL syntax.
- **Required**: A database connection must be established for the server to run properly.
- If you have no database, you can modify the code to not call the load and save component functions in the `SwimPlayer` class
- Slight caveat, the yaml files in config and local database are formatted a bit different, local database wants things wrapped in quotes for each field.

### Configuration:

1. **config.yml:**
```yaml
---
database:
  host: # IP address of the database
  username: 
  password: 
  schema: 
  port: 3306
  workerLimit: 2
motds: # List of MOTDs to cycle through in the client's UI
- §bSWIM.GG
- §9SCRIMS
...
```

2. **localDatabase.yml (For development environments):**
```yaml
database:
  main:
    host: "127.0.0.1"
    username: "root"
    password: 
    schema: 
    port: 3306
  worker-limit: 2
```

## Designed to be a library based "AAA" Game Engine

- **Core Design**: 
  - Powered by a **System Manager** class that updates core systems every tick and second for:
    - Scenes
    - Players
    - Actors
    - Events
    - Behaviors
  - Everything is sorted into **scenes** to encapsulate and simplify server logic.
    - Example: Hub, Kit FFA, and duels are all scenes.
    - Everything updates each tick within its respective scene.
  - Players and actors follow a basic **ECS (Entity Component System)** for data storage and per player specific behavior scripting.
- **Custom Actor Class**:
  - Custom entities can have any skin, geo, animations, and behavior scripts.
  - This is set up using a resource pack identical to how the Customies library works.

### Key Features:
- **Scenes**: Hub, Kit FFA, duels, and other parts of the server are handled as separate scenes.
- **Player ECS**: Entity Component System used to handle player behaviors and callbacks.
- **Custom Actors**: Create custom entities with skins, geometries, and behaviors to control them.

### Duel & FFA scenes with Queueing + Map Pools

- Configure your duels in `data/duels.json` to be used in the Queue scene with proper configuration.
- Any `FFA` deriving scene during `init` can set the `protected FFAInfo $info` field to assist in registration.
- Currently all Map Pools must be manually defined and allocated inside `MapsData::$mapPools`.

---

## Auto-Loading of Actors, Commands, and Scenes

One of the most powerful features of SwimCore is the ability to **auto-load PHP scripts** on server start-up without manually registering them.

### Auto-Loading Mechanism:
- **Scenes**: Any script in the `core\scenes` namespace that implements `public static function AutoLoad(): bool` will be auto-loaded into the `SceneSystem`.
- **Actors**: Scripts in the `core\custom\prefabs` namespace will automatically register entities in the entity factory.
- **Commands**: Scripts in the `core\commands` namespace will auto-register commands.
- This works for sub folders in these directories too! Fully recursive and smart class script type detection.

---

## Fun Extras

- **Examples**: 
  - Includes examples of simple duels and FFA scenes (nodebuff, boxing, midfight).
  - Abstract class `SkyGoalGame` to work as a base implementation for games like Bridge or Battle Rush.
- **Code Highlights**:
  - Lots of UI form code.
  - Custom items and actors in the `prefabs` namespace (Basic Actor example script and some Potions and Pearls and other PvP things).
  - Player behavior event scripts (`NoFall`, `DoubleJump`, `MaxDistance`).
  - JSON map data deserialization for arenas (maps namespace).
- **Systems Included**: Full implementation of swim.gg's **server event** and **party systems**.

---

## IMPORTANT

This repo contains only the **game engine**.

- **Anticheat and Security**: Any swim.gg anticheat detections and major player login security implementations are excluded. However, the base anticheat framework is included!
- **Raklib**: Our Raklib implementation is now included, which allows highly customized network protocol actions and rotating MOTDs. We highly reccomend you use NGPM or our custom fork of PM to enable this system to work properly.
- **Discord Communicator**: Our discord integration is now included in SwimCore publicly. This can be used for linking discord accounts to players in your database and talking to the server with your bots back and forth.
- **Database Tables**: Contains basic tables for storing player history, settings, punishments, and ranks.
- **Punishment Commands**: Muting and banning commands are included, but without advanced features like alternate account tracking via client data collection.

## In Progress

- Bots with behaviors and pathing. Right now just have a basic follow bot with an editable inventory.
- Replay system (needs animations and some bug fixes for armor) + support for other actors and database serialization + performance profiling.

## TODO

- Hot reloading + anytime loading of Scenes, Actors, Behaviors, and Command scripts. No more restarting the server to test a new feature.
- Cosmetic 3D geometry system that works via components per player for doing things like wings and hats and back bling.
- Automated tournament system.
- Clans/guilds.
- Elo leaderboards.
- Truly custom item system (right now just overrides callbacks on existing items such as OnUseEvent)
- Custom blocks (needed for retexturing of things like knock back TNT)
- Automatic arena copy and pasting + generating spawn positions from a single plotted out arena.
