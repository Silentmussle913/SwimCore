# API Coverage Report

This report lists counts of files per module discovered during scanning of `src/core`.

- commands: 62 files
- utils: 82 files
- systems: 60 files
- scenes: 18 files
- custom: 54 files
- database: 4 files
- forms: 14 files
- listeners: 3 files
- maps: 2 files
- communicator: 31 files
- tasks: 2 files
- plugin core: 2 files (SwimCore.php, SwimCoreInstance.php)

Total scanned PHP files: ~336 (matches repo scan)

Notes:
- Each folder's files are listed in `docs/api/FILES.md` and summarized on every module page.
- If you'd like per-class method and argument documentation, I can generate `docs/api/classes/<Class>.md` pages, extracting docblocks and method signatures for each PHP class automatically or manually (this is more work but can be automated with a script).
